# 🌍 RunMyWorld — AI Agents That Execute Things for You

### 🚀 Overview

**RunMyWorld** is an AI-powered automation platform that lets users create and manage intelligent **agents** — such as a Fitness Coach, Travel Planner, or Productivity Assistant — that can run tasks **locally or in the cloud**.

This project is being developed as part of **VibeState ’25**, a week-long AI Vibeathon organized by **Singularity** in collaboration with **RunAnywhere** and **Firebender**.

---

### 💡 Project Vision

We aim to build a **hybrid ecosystem** that combines a **Web Dashboard** (for creating and managing agents) and a **Mobile App** (that executes them using the **RunAnywhere SDK**).

The goal is to demonstrate how autonomous AI agents can perform everyday tasks seamlessly across devices.

---

### 🧩 Core Features

* 🧠 **Custom AI Agents** – Create specialized agents with unique goals and personalities.
* ⚡ **RunAnywhere SDK Integration** – Execute agent scripts either locally or via the cloud.
* 🔄 **Web + Mobile Sync** – Real-time synchronization between dashboard and mobile app.
* 🔔 **Activity Notifications** – Alerts for task completions or agent updates.
* 🔒 **Secure Data Storage** – Encrypted local storage using AndroidX Security Crypto.
